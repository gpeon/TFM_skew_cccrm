The Concordance Correlation Coefficient has been one of the key analysis measures of concordance in particular for the repeated measures outcomes in the continuous scale. The coefficient relies on a key distributional assumption of normality of the response variable. In this thesis the main estimation approaches for the longitudinal CCC have been reviewed through simulation sets under distributional misspecifications, where both bayesian and bootstrap Bca approaches obtained the better coverage, but nonetheless all reviewed methods failed to reach its nominal coverage under strong right-skewness on the response variable. The application of popular transformations for the asymptotic estimate did not provide visible coverage improvements, while in the presence of a drop-out pattern robust methods that require complete case analysis were significantly limited for the longitudinal CCC estimation.
