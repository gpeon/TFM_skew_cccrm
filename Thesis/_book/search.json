    "text": "Abstract\nThe Concordance Correlation Coefficient has been one of the key analysis measures of concordance in particular for the repeated measures outcomes in the continuous scale. The coefficient relies on a key distributional assumption of normality of the response variable. In this thesis the main estimation approaches for the longitudinal CCC have been reviewed through simulation sets under distributional misspecifications, where both bayesian and bootstrap Bca approaches obtained the better coverage, but nonetheless all reviewed methods failed to reach its nominal coverage under strong right-skewness on the response variable. The application of popular transformations for the asymptotic estimate did not provide visible coverage improvements, while in the presence of a drop-out pattern robust methods that require complete case analysis were significantly limited for the longitudinal CCC estimation.\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

    "text": "The misspecification of the distributional assumption of the Concordance Correlation Coefficient has led to the exploration of two avenues in order to address it: Fit an appropriate model and update the coefficient’s formula accordingly (Josep L. Carrasco (2009)), or to find robust methods of estimation of the coefficient (King and Chinchilli (2001b),Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2018)). In this thesis the focus will be placed on the latter, which has been the main line of study in the literature (already in the coefficient’s proposal, Lin tested the robustness the coefficient under misspecification of the distribution), comparing the robustness (through coverage and bias) of different estimation methods that have been expanded or proposed since Josep L. Carrasco et al. (2007). These methods will be compared in a simulation study under five different levels of longitudinal concordance, and three levels of skewness.\nThe impact of transformations of the data, in particular the log-transformation, in order to obtain normality and its connection to the correlation coefficient, will be assessed in the first case study, a small dataset with moderate skewness of bacterial colony formations in paired molar samples. The second case study will review a large longitudinal dataset with time-varying concordance, potential covariates, and a significant dropout process, where possible under or overspecification has been reviewed, accompanied with an assessment of the impact of the observed missing pattern on the estimation methods.\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

    "text": "3.1 The robust U-statistics estimate\nIn contrast to the Overall CCC, which was developed and defined as a weighted average of the pairwise CCC, focusing on extending the coefficient for multiple observers, the focus of the Generalized CCC when it was first proposed in King and Chinchilli (2001a), was to extend the coefficient for the cases where the squared distance function (\\((Y_1-Y_2)^2\\)) might not have been appropriate, which is the case under non-normality, to a whole family of convex continuous distance functions (\\(g(Y_1-Y_2)\\)), with some Winsored versions and Huber’s function showing greater robustness. For the comparison of two methods, the GCCC formula is the following:\n\\[CCC = \\frac{[E_{F_{Y_1} F_{Y_2}}g(Y_1-Y_2)-E_{F_{Y_1} F_{Y_2}}g(Y_1+Y_2)]-[E_{F_{Y_1Y_2}}g(Y_1-Y_2)-E_{F_{Y_1Y_2}}g(Y_1+Y_2)]}{E_{F_{Y_1} F_{Y_2}}g(Y_1-Y_2)-E_{F_{Y_1} F_{Y_2}}g(Y_1+Y_2) + \\frac{1}{2}(E_{F_{Y_1}}g(2{Y_1})+E_{F_{Y_2}}g(2Y_2))}\\]\nWhich could be reduced to the following form for estimation by replacing the terms with the U-statistics which they showed to be unbiased estimators for the previous terms for a sample size of size \\(n\\):\n\\[\\hat{CCC} = \\frac{(n-1)(U_3-U_1)}{U_1 + nU_2 + (n-1)U_3}\\]\nThen, in King and Chinchilli (2001b), the authors extended the coefficient to the multiple raters case by replacing the \\(U_1\\), \\(U_2\\) and \\(U_3\\) by their sum across all the unique pairs \\(U_{1S}\\), \\(U_{2S}\\) and \\(U_{3S}\\), given the U-statistics property that the sum of the U-statistics is in itself a U-statistic, and proved that the multi-rater version of the coefficient still was asymptotically normal.\n\\[\\hat{CCC} = \\frac{(n-1)(U_{3S}-U_{1S})}{U_{1S} + nU_{2S} + (n-1)U_{3S}}\\]\nIt was finally extended to the repeated measures case, with particular attention for longitudinal data, in King, Chinchilli, and Carrasco (2007), where \\(nU\\) was the unbiased estimator of the expected value of the weighted squared differences \\(E[(X-Y)'D(X-Y)]\\) and \\(U+(n-1)V\\) the unbiased estimator of the previous expected value under independence.\n\\[\\hat{CCC} = \\frac{(n-1)(V-U)}{U + (n-1)V}\\]",

    "section": "3.2 The Variance Components Approach",
    "text": "3.2 The Variance Components Approach\nIn this thesis the Concordance Correlation Coefficient formula which be mainly discussed is the one proposed in Carrasco (2003), estimated through the variance components. It suggests a linear mixed measurement model where the continuous variable is measured a total of \\(m\\) times (the product between the \\(n\\) number of subjects, \\(k\\) number of raters, and \\(l\\) number of replicates), which requires that every possible combination of raters and times to be accounted. Also, the explanation has been limited to a specific type of block diagonal, with the condition of identity, for the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects of the underlying LMM. The proposed model was the following: \\(Y_{ijl} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ijl}\\), with \\(i=1,...,n\\) subjects, \\(j = 1,...,k\\) raters and \\(l=1,...,r\\) replicates; where \\(\\mu\\), the overall mean, and \\(\\beta_j\\), the rater \\(j\\) effect, are the fixed effects; and \\(\\alpha_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2)\\), the individual effect, and \\(\\epsilon_{ijl} \\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)\\), the random error, which are the random effects of the model.\n\\(CCC = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2}{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2 + \\sigma_{\\beta}^2+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2}\\).\nWorking with the restriction on the sum of the rater effects have to be equal to zero (\\(\\sum_{j=1}^k \\beta_j = 0\\)), the variability among all raters can be derived:\n\\[\\hat \\sigma_{\\beta}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} \\sum_{j'=j+1}^{k} (\\beta_j-\\beta_{j'})^2}{k(k-1)}\\]\nIt has also been derived in terms of the raters means, given that the rater effect (under the expressed conditions) is just the difference between the mean of the particular rater and the global mean, which was a step taken to proof the concordance with the other CCC proposals. The issue of this estimate is that in Searle, Casella, and McCulloch (1992) it was proven to be biased, which then led to the expression of the unbiased estimate in the matrix form \\(\\hat \\sigma_{\\beta}^2 = \\frac{1}{k(k-1)} \\{\\hat\\beta'LL'\\hat\\beta - trace(LL'\\hat \\Sigma_\\beta)\\}\\), where \\(L\\) is the fixed effects contrast matrix and \\(\\hat\\Sigma_\\beta\\) is the variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects3.\nThe formula was first expanded in L. Lin, Hedayat, and Wu (2007) with a subject-rater interaction term (random effect) \\(\\alpha\\beta_{ij} \\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^2)\\), and then further expanded for repeated measurements, with particular attention to the longitudinal case (Carrasco, 2009), which led to the inclusion of a further subindex \\(t\\) to allow multiple replicates per individual per time. The Variance Components approach to estimate the longitudinal CCC with repeated measures rests on the following Normal-Normal Linear Mixed effects model:\n\\[Y_{ijtl} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\gamma_t + \\alpha\\beta_{ij} + \\alpha\\gamma_{it} + \\beta\\gamma_{jt} + \\epsilon_{ijtl}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_j\\) and \\(\\gamma_t\\) are the fixed effects related with method and time, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, and the rest of the components are the random effects of the model (which are assumed to be normal). For the estimation of the variance that comes from the systematic differences between observers across time (the fixed effects) a similar correction was applied: \\(\\hat\\sigma_{\\beta\\gamma}^2 = \\frac{1}{pk(k-1)} \\{\\hat\\beta'LL'\\hat\\beta - trace(LL'\\hat \\Sigma_\\beta)\\}\\), with \\(p\\) reflecting the number of times. The final formula is the following:\n\\[CCC = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2 + \\sigma_{\\alpha\\gamma}^2}{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2 + \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^2 + \\sigma_{\\alpha\\gamma}^2 + \\sigma_{\\beta\\gamma}^2+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2}\\]",

    "text": "3.3 A Bayesian Estimate\nA proposal for the CCC was later developed under the bayesian approach in Bhattacharjee and Bhattacharyya (2015), which was then expanded in Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2015) and in Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2018) by defining robust priors to handle skewed data, and in Vanbelle and Lesaffre (2017) the distributions for bounded data. While this approach can be computationally expensive, and require an extensive number of iterations for the CCC to reach a reasonable effective sample size in the MCMC4, and be burdened to misspecification due to the explicit definition of the model assumptions that are required, through a proper selection of selection of the priors, a bayesian CCC estimate might show to be more robust than the estimates were the assumptions are taken implicitly. For the purpose of this thesis, the estimate has been extended to the longitudinal case through the Variance Components approach previously explained, and the fitting of the Linear Mixed Model has fully implemented in R, only requiring the installation of R packages and without the requirement of external software (previous implementations required the installation of jags, but now the bayesian inference is carried through stan (2024))5. The hierarchical priors for the standard deviations and for the error term of the LMM are truncated at zero, in order to avoid negative values, t-student distributions with \\(3\\) degrees of freedom and a standard deviation of \\(2.5\\), while the fixed intercept \\(\\mu\\) has also a t-student prior, which it is not truncated, and has a default value of \\(5.8\\). The selection of the priors has purposely been confined to weakly informative priors, which were modified appropriately for the lognormal-normal model extension6.\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

The marginal covariance can also be expanded, given the assumption that the effects that condition the observations are independent, as \\(cov(Y_{ijl},Y_{ij'l'}) = cov_u(\\mu_{ij},\\mu_{ij'})\\).\nThis led to the definition of a general formula for the Generalized Concordance Correlation Coefficient: \\(GCCC = \\frac{cov_u(\\mu_{ij},\\mu_{ij'})}{var_u(\\mu_{ij})+E_u[\\phi h(\\mu_{ij})]}\\).\nGiven that under a Normal distributed response variable the terms can be expressed in the form (as in Josep L.

An extended review of this parametrization for Variance Components, U-statistics and GEE can be found in Tsai and Lin (2018).\nSimilarly for the Negative-Binomial distribution: \\(CCC = \\frac{\\mu(e^{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2 + \\sigma_{\\alpha\\gamma}^2}-1)}{\\mu((r+1)e^{\\sigma_{\\alpha}^2+\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^2+\\sigma_{\\alpha\\gamma}^2+\\sigma_{\\beta\\gamma}^2}-1) + \\phi}\\).

    "text": "4.3 The Skew-Normal Model\nThe last proposal to be reviewed can be seen as a hybrid approach between the correct specification and the robust estimators. In Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2018), the authors propose the skew-normal distribution (a generalization of the normal distribution that allows skewness), while maintain the standard CCC formula, after applying a correction on the estimated parameters, with \\(\\mu_j^* = \\mu_j + \\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\delta_j\\) and \\(\\Sigma^* = \\Sigma + (1-\\frac{2}{\\pi})\\delta\\delta'\\). The development for a skew-t-student distribution was also provided. As of 2024, while there has been no proposed extension to the longitudinal case, since june the underlying model required can now be fitted through the glmmtmb formula of the glmmtmb3 R package (from a frequentist perspective) or through the function provided developed here for the bayesian method (which relies on the brms4implementation).\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

    "text": "5.1 Methods\nAcross the literature, four main approaches have been identified in order to obtain robust estimates of the Concordance Correlation Coefficient and its standard error: The U-statistics approach, which was initially proposed in King and Chinchilli (2001b) and then implemented in R with the Josep Lluis Carrasco and Pena (2024) package; the Generalized Estimated Equations approach proposed in Barnhart, Haber, and Song (2002); the Variance Components approach proposed in Josep L. Carrasco and Jover (2003) (same implementation as the U-statistics1); and the Bayesian framework discussed in Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2015) and implemented in the agRee2 R package. Given the interest of working with repeated measures and longitudinal data, the GEE approach has not been evaluated (given that we currently lack an implementation that fulfills our requirements), while the bayesian framework has been adapted in order to handle a longitudinal response, and to not require external applications.\nThe Variance Components approach has been split into two categories with regards to the estimation of the standard deviation of coefficient. The first one of those is the one initially presented in L. I.-K. Lin (1989) for the bivariate case (\\(m = 2\\), which I’ll be refering as the F2 transformation), taking advantage of the properties of the delta method, which then it could also be transformed, using Fisher’s3 z-transformation \\(z = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(\\frac{1+(m-1)\\rho_{ccc}}{1-\\rho_{ccc}})\\), or to the modified Z-transformation by Konishi and Gupta (1987), \\(z = \\sqrt\\frac{m-1}{2m} \\ln(\\frac{1+(m-1)\\rho_{ccc}}{1-\\rho_{ccc}})\\) which has a slight bias in the mean of \\(\\frac{7-5m}{N\\sqrt{18m(m-1)}}\\) and a variance of \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\). This later transformation was recommended in Donner and Zou (2002) for situations with more than two replicates (\\(m\\)) per individual. The second category refers to the usage of resampling techniques in order to obtain the estimates of the standard error and construct confidence intervals for the parameter. Within this field different resampling techniques have been proposed, as the jackniffe in Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2013), but the analysis has been restricted to bootstrap implementations, very popular in the literature where they have been a common comparison to any proposal and obtaining consistently comparable results4. Both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap5 implementations were considered, and for their confidence intervals both percentile and Bias-Corrected-and-Accelerated6 (Bca) were tested.\nThe Bayesian implementation is based (the ccc_vc_bayes function, which is also available as an .R file) in the approach in Feng, Baumgartner, and Svetnik (2015) (which also used the variance components estimate), which I extended to consider the longitudinal case and the non-longitudinal case with the subject-method interaction. I first developed the model all the random effects under a normal distributional assumption (information about the priors in the next section), and then I also considered the case where the subject effect followed a lognormal distribution (I extended the lognormal–normal linear mixed model proposed in Josep L. Carrasco et al. (2007)). Given that I expected that I already expected that the standard deviation of the log subject effect was going to be relatively small (&lt;&lt; generally smaller than 1), I decided to choose a \\(\\sigma_{\\ln_\\alpha} \\sim \\Gamma(1.5,2)\\) prior7 in order to avoid boundary issues close to 0. The function acts as a wrapper of the brms8 R package functions stancode and standata, which produce a linear mixed model stan file and adapt the data into a stan readable format, respectively, which are then internally edited to conform with the CCC definition as it can be seen in the cccrm R package (one of the key modifications that has to be made for the stan model to comply with the underlying LMM of the CCC derived through Variance Components is that the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects is assumed to be a block diagonal matrix with an identity condition).",

    "text": "5.2 Design\nConcordance in each simulation set has been evaluated at 5 levels (at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and at 0.9), in order to evaluate whether there is some differential performance close to the coefficient’s bounds. Each simulation contains one thousand replicates. In all cases the number of bootstrap resamples has been five hundred. The following estimation methods were evaluated: one asymptotic approach with four methods for interval estimation (No transformation, Fisher’s transformation, F2 transformation, Konishi-Gupta’s transformation), two bootstrap approaches (parametric and non-parametric) with two methods for interval estimation (empirical and BCa), the U-statistics approach, and a Bayesian Normal-Normal approach9. The four simulation sets included evaluating the default longitudinal case of two observers in two times plus two replicates per combination of observer and time (which leads to a complete design where each subject was evaluated eight times). The first two simulation sets were generated under a Normal-Normal model (both the subjects’ effect and the response are normally distributed), with the objective to review the impact of sample size (30 vs 120 individuals). The third and fourth simulation sets reflect on the inclusion of a lightly and a heavily skewed subjects’ effect through a Lognormal-Normal design in the overall estimation.\nFor all simulation sets, the bayesian method’s simulations were run on a ten thousand to one thousand iterations to burnin split, in order to produce a meaningful effective sample size for the coefficient. Nonetheless and upon review, while convergence is guaranteed, divergent transitions still have appeared. On further testing the problem seems to be solved by increasing the iterations to be discarded (burnin) to fifteen hundred.\n\n5.2.1 First set\nLongitudinal design.

Comparatively the asymptotic model failed in 5% of the simulations for the 0.1 CCC and in 1% of the simulations for the 0.9 CCC. The bootstrap methods had a higher degree of convergence failure across the board, only being comparable at 0.1 with a failure rate of 5%, which grew to 22% failure rate for a CCC of 0.9. The non-parametric approach with the available version on the package failed at a larger rate, which will be updated. The main cause of the failures of the methods that relied on the asymptotic estimate were due to failures of the lme model in computing the Hessian matrix.\n\n\n5.2.2 Second set\nLongitudinal design.

    "text": "5.3 Results\nThe four confidence interval construction methods for the asymptotic coefficient showed comparable coverage across the entire set. Given that the F2 transformation was proposed only for two replicates per individual, while both the Fisher’s and the Konishi-Gupta transformation were generalized for any number of consistent replicates across individuals, it is still an important finding that the F2 still held for eight replicates. The robust U-statistics approach failed to provide its nominal coverage in all four sets and performed only comparable with the asymptotic approach in the heavily skewed case. The bootstrap approaches, which resampled the asymptotic CCC estimate, were the second most computationally expensive and those that showed the largest failure rate with regards of the estimation, and even after a revision to include parallelized batching and better error handling, while the improvement was notable the issues still remained.. The Bayesian approach was the most computationally expensive by a wide margin, and it requires a rather large number of iterations (and iterations to discard) in order to converge in a reasonable effective sample size, but showed some of the best performance (only outperformed by the non-parametric bootstrap in specific cases) even when failing to reach its nominal value. The use of a MAP (Maximum a posteriori probability) estimate as a point estimate did not produce a larger bias than the asymptotic or U-statistics point estimate, and it had the second lowest failure rate with regards of estimation. A Bayesian Lognormal-Normal estimate was also implemented but it requires further testing, and the approach could then be extended to handle other distributions.\nTables with the failure rates, mean skewness and average bias have been provided in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

    "text": "6.1 Results\nWhen working with the untransformed variable, the variance components obtained through the model are themselves levels of magnitude apart (the estimated subject variance was in the order of e+04 while the estimated methods variance and error term were in the order of e+11), which leads to rather extremely small estimated values for the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (for which in the case of the U-statistic estimate even gives a negative value outside of the coefficient’s range). The issues with the estimation of the CCC in this dataset also continue when providing 95% confidence intervals (or 95% highest density intervals for the bayesian case), for which the asymptotic method both in its base form and when it relies upon Fisher’s Z-transformation, it provides negative lower bound estimates (outside of the bounds of the coefficient), which is also the case for the empirical bootstrap intervals and the U-statistic estimate. The problem observed with the confidence interval after applying the Konishi-Gupta transformation, is that the coefficient estimate lies outside of the CI provided. In that sense, the only non-ill-behaved estimates correspond to the bootstrap BCa estimates (both parametric and non-parametric), and the Bayesian model estimate provided. The other Bayesian implementation reviewed (Normal-Normal and Skewnormal-Normal from the agRee7 R package) also fails to produce estimates within the bounds of the coefficient.\nCCC for CFU/ml model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCCC\nLL CI 95%\nUL CI 95%\nSE CCC\n\n\n\n\nAsymptotic\n5.073e-08\n-1.344e-05\n1.354e-05\n6.885e-06\n\n\nAsymptotic (Fisher’s Z)\n5.073e-08\n-1.344e-05\n1.354e-05\n6.885e-06\n\n\nAsymptotic (Z, m=2)\n5.073e-08\n-1.344e-05\n1.354e-05\n6.885e-06\n\n\nAsymptotic (KG transf)\n5.073e-08\n0.01514\n0.01516\n6.885e-06\n\n\nParam Boot BCa\n5.073e-08\n1.124e-08\n0.3248\n0.07331\n\n\nParam Boot Emp\n5.073e-08\n-0.2381\n9.681e-08\n0.07221\n\n\nNon-Param Boot BCa\n5.073e-08\n1.486e-08\n0.2524\n0.05034\n\n\nNon-Param Boot Emp\n5.073e-08\n-0.1784\n9.553e-08\n0.05043\n\n\nU-stat\n-0.03049\n-0.2377\n0.1794\n0.108\n\n\nN-N Bayesian (MAP)\n0.0005366\n2.027e-09\n0.2384\n0.08048\n\n\nN-N Bayesian (agRee)\n-0.0288\n-0.2468\n0.1935\nNA\n\n\nSkew-N Bayesian (agRee)\n-0.004061\n-0.1704\n0.1693\nNA\nAfter applying the log-transformation, the estimated variance components are of a similar magnitude, and the point estimate for the coefficient has grown across the board (independent of the estimation method). Nonetheless, the lower bound provided by the asymptotic estimate (even after applying Fisher’s Z-transform) still falls outside the coefficient’s domain. A second point of relevance has been the stabilization of the estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient, which has grown comparatively much more for the asymptotic method, while for the Bayesian and bootstrap cases only doubled, and it remained reasonably consistent for the U-statistic estimate. Finally, the MAP (Bayesian) estimate of the coefficient clearly diverges from the rest, even when it provides a similar upper bound to other methods, while it remains the most consistent with its estimate for the non-transformed case. The only other estimate close, but still over the samples’ spearman correlation coefficient is the skewnormal-normal bayesian estimate, which would indicate that even after the transformation, which effectively shifted the skewness but failed to reduce its magnitude, the generalization approach for the normal distribution, might still not be appropriate.\nCCC for log(CFU/ml) model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCCC\nLL CI 95%\nUL CI 95%\nSE CCC\n\n\n\n\nAsymptotic\n0.2616\n-0.0005759\n0.5237\n0.1337\n\n\nAsymptotic (Fisher’s Z)\n0.2616\n-0.0136\n0.4999\n0.1337\n\n\nAsymptotic (Z, m=2)\n0.2616\n-0.0136\n0.4999\n0.1337\n\n\nAsymptotic (KG transf)\n0.2616\n0.001547\n0.5112\n0.1337\n\n\nParam Boot BCa\n0.2616\n0.01546\n0.4862\n0.1211\n\n\nParam Boot Emp\n0.2616\n0.006969\n0.5231\n0.1288\n\n\nNon-Param Boot BCa\n0.2616\n7.028e-09\n0.4886\n0.1334\n\n\nNon-Param Boot Emp\n0.2616\n0.01251\n0.5231\n0.1365\n\n\nU-stat\n0.2557\n0.01516\n0.4682\n0.1175\n\n\nN-N Bayesian (MAP)\n0.002884\n3.778e-11\n0.4847\n0.1503\n\n\nN-N Bayesian (agRee)\n0.254\n0.001095\n0.5077\nNA\n\n\nSkew-N Bayesian (agRee)\n0.1776\n-0.05301\n0.4336\nNA",

    "text": "7.1 Results\nFirst, a comment on the methods implementation and observed issues when computing the Concordance Correlation Coefficient. On their current implementation in the cccrm package, both the parametric bootstrap implementation from the ccc_vc function and the U-statistics estimate implemented in the cccUst function, showed problems handling missing observations. The issue for the parametric bootstrap case can be solved with dropping the missing observations and working with the available cases, while for the case of the U-statistics estimate, its implementation works under the assumption of equal number of observations per subject, and thus it requires a deeper review. Thus, I reflected the estimates for three levels of complete cases: those that went through at least 6 visits (106 patients), those that reached the 9th visit (72 patients), and those that reached the penultimate visit (only 17 patients). While the presence of a drop-out mechanism in the response variable should not by itself suggest any issue with the Concordance Correlation Coefficient estimate, in the degree that the non-observed samples (MNAR) or the omitted individuals (MAR) had shown a differential degree of concordance between T1Wi and TW2i, the Linear Mixed Models assumptions may not hold, and as it was used to provide the coefficients estimates these might also not hold.\nWhen reviewing the results, beyond the limitation of the U-statistics implementation, first is noticeable how the MAP estimate3 falls lower than the estimates provided by the other methods, while showing comparable (but larger) bounds for the coefficient. This is also can be noticed in the estimate of the standard error provided, which is clearly larger for the Bayesian and the non-parametric bootstrap estimates, while the asymptotic method and the parametric bootstrap remain more consistent.\nCCC\nLL CI 95%\nUL CI 95%\nSE CCC\n\n\n\n\nAsymptotic\n0.1942\n0.1226\n0.2658\n0.03651\n\n\nAsymptotic (Fisher’s Z)\n0.1942\n0.1294\n0.2722\n0.03651\n\n\nAsymptotic (Z, m=2)\n0.1989\n0.1257\n0.27\n0.03686\n\n\nAsymptotic (KG transf)\n0.1942\n0.1313\n0.2749\n0.03651\n\n\nParam Boot BCa (AC)\n0.1942\n0.1155\n0.2616\n0.03815\n\n\nParam Boot Emp (AC)\n0.1942\n0.1273\n0.2727\n0.0375\n\n\nNon-Param Boot BCa\n0.1942\n0.08988\n0.2657\n0.04436\n\n\nNon-Param Boot Emp\n0.1942\n0.1228\n0.2937\n0.04542\n\n\nU-stat (AC)\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nU-stat (CC-6)\n0.2364\n0.01214\n0.4381\n0.1102\n\n\nU-stat (CC-9)\n0.2581\n0.04362\n0.4498\n0.105\n\n\nU-stat (CC-11)\n0.1488\n-0.01856\n0.308\n0.08404\n\n\nN-N Bayesian (MAP)\n0.1308\n0.09267\n0.3339\n0.0727\nThe inclusion of the two possible covariates, the practitioner and the machine used in the evaluation, while for all methods reduce the CCC point estimate, their inclusion as fixed effects do not dramatically shift the coefficient’s confidence intervals.

    "text": "7.2 Missingness pattern\nIt felt rather important to review, for the adequacy of the application of the Complete Case Analysis for the concordance whether the dropout pattern in the dataset had any relationship with the degree of concordance between pairs, as if the observed pairs excluded in the complete case analysis presented a different degree of concordance (significantly more or less concordant) than the remaining pairs, we would be under a Missing At Random pattern, and the complete cases estimate would be biased. In order to review it, and with the awareness that the concordance was also time dependent, a comparison between the concordance of the pairs which were at the last visit of the subject versus the rest of the pairs was done for each visiting time. Then, the separation between the 95% confidence intervals at each time was assessed, with the only meaningful difference in Concordance happening at the fourth visit (where the nine subjects that dropped out had highly discordant samples). There was also no significant difference in concordance at each time when comparing the concordance of all available pairs versus the subset of pairs of continuing subjects, which would indicate that for this particular dataset the limitation of a Complete Case Analysis for the concordance correlation coefficient will not come from the missingness mechanism of the present dropout, but on the selection of the cut-off visit. To produce comparable estimates for methods that require complete cases to those under an Available Case framework, imputation strategies should be reviewed.\n\n\n\nTable continues below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit\nMissing\nLast_Visit\nCCC\nCCC_LV\nCCC_Other\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0.1016\n-\n0.1016\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n-\n-\n0.1605\n\n\n3\n0\n2\n0.3137\n-\n0.3237\n\n\n4\n2\n9\n0.3643\n2.892e-10\n0.4622\n\n\n5\n11\n14\n0.1558\n0.01786\n0.1605\n\n\n6\n25\n13\n-\n0.3189\n0.08091\n\n\n7\n38\n7\n0.1666\n-\n0.1785\n\n\n8\n45\n17\n0.2859\n0.031\n0.2784\n\n\n9\n62\n31\n0.1975\n0.2869\n-\n\n\n10\n93\n27\n0.2245\n0.2311\n7.853e-09\n\n\n11\n120\n15\n0.03061\n0.04555\n-\n\n\n12\n135\n4\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsig_ccc\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\nSignficantly Less Concordant\n\n\nNo significant differences\n\n\nNo significant differences\n\n\n-\n\n\nNo significant differences\n\n\n-\n\n\nNo significant differences\n\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\nArmour, Marc, Joanne Michou, Imogen Schofield, and Karla Borland. 2024. “Agreement of Doppler Ultrasound and Visual Sphygmomanometer Needle Oscillation with Invasive Blood Pressure in Anaesthetised Dogs.” Animals 14 (19): 2756. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14192756.\n\n\nBahloul, Mohamed A., Saima Jabeen, Sara Benoumhani, Habib Abdulmohsen Alsaleh, Zehor Belkhatir, and Areej Al-Wabil. 2024. “Advancements in Synthetic CT Generation from MRI: A Review of Techniques, and Trends in Radiation Therapy Planning.” Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics 25 (11). https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.14499.\n\n\nBarnhart, Huiman X., Michael Haber, and Jingli Song. 2002. “Overall Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Evaluating Agreement Among Multiple Observers.” Biometrics 58 (4): 1020–27. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.01020.x.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, Atanu, and Tapesh Bhattacharyya. 2015. “Bayesian Concordance Correlation Coefficient with Application to Repeatedly Measured Data.” Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Biostatistics 7 (2): 55–62. https://doi.org/10.5336/biostatic.2015-46702.\n\n\nBrooks, Mollie E., Kasper Kristensen, Koen J. van, Arni Magnusson, Casper W.

    "text": "8.1 Limitations\nWhile the simulation sets reviewed represented a thorough analysis on the nominal coverage of the current estimation approaches for the Concordance Correlation Coefficient, which were complimented with the inclusion of two case studies, there were many relevant situations still pending to be tested. The analysis therefore could be expanded by selecting a different number of subjects, raters, and observation times, simulating with alternative weights for the variance components and other levels of skewness. With regards of the model structure, the reviewed CCC approaches could be compared with others that assume the fixed effects to be random, or that the skewness present in the longitudinal response is not only produced by the subjects-effect but also by the subject-time or subject-method interactions. Known approaches, such as skewnormal-normal models and generalized estimating equations, have yet to be extended for the repeated measures CCC, but have shown properties relevant to address moderate skewness.\nThe simulations were limited to longitudinal designs without missingness, but as seen in the second case study, the introduction of a drop-out pattern could hamper some of the available methods, and the impact of popular imputation techniques with regards to concordance has yet to be studied. Also, possible misspecification is not limited to the skewness produced by a log-normal effect, and the effect of under and overspecification on the underlying model was not reviewed in the present simulation sets.",

    "text": "8.2 Conclusions\nThe variance component approach is currently one of the most well developed and extensive approaches in order to assess the concordance between multiple raters in a repeated measures context, with particular emphasis in longitudinal outcomes. Most approaches reviewed were or have been included in the R package cccrm.\nThe application of transformations in the context of the presented simulation sets and the case studies do not seem to provide any sizable improvement over the default asymptotic approach. Both the empirical bootstrap and U-statistics methods generally failed to achieve its nominal coverage, while both the BCa bootstrap and the bayesian implementation based on the normal-normal model showed reasonable improvements in coverage, even if point estimate bias remained comparable. Another key insight is that the relevant misspecification is not the strength of skewness of the random effect itself, but of the response variable, which when it presents a strong skewness all tested methods fail to reach its nominal coverage. For the simulated right skewness better coverage was seen for high concordance values.\nIn the first case study it was observed that the application of the log-transformation on the response variable may not be an appropriate technique when the objective is to assess concordance, as most concordance estimates on the log-transformed response were greater than the estimated correlation, with the correlation being a natural upper bound for the CCC. Then, the second case study reflects that for the longitudinal assessment of concordance the selection of the cut-off points and covariates are meaningful choices, and when a drop-out mechanism is present and it is not at MNAR pattern, methods that model on available cases should be preferred.",

Given that for the simulations \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) was fixed at 0.5, the lognormal scale parameter can be derived with the following formula:\n\\[\\sigma^2 = \\log \\left( \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1+4\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{\\exp(2\\mu)}}}{2} \\right)\\]\nThe location parameter \\(\\mu\\) then allows to control the degree of skewness for a same level of variance (as by reducing the location parameter the scale parameter increases). The two values used in the simulations were \\(-\\log(1)\\) and \\(-\\log(10)\\) in order to produce different levels of skewness (2.03 and 24.6).\nWhile in both scenarios the subject effect presents a strong skewness, the skewness of the response variable (which is a sum of the fixed and random effects) is moderated by the other normally distributed variance components, given that the skewness be formulated as a ratio between the mean and the variance \\(\\gamma_1 = \\frac{\\mu_3}{(\\sigma^2)^{3/2}}\\), and as the normal random effects are centered at zero they only contribute increasing the total variance of the response variable, and thus reducing the final skewness. The resulting skewness is further discussed in the next section.",

    "text": "A.3 Extra tables\nAs commented in the first set of simulations, both bayesian and U-statistic estimators did not present any significant rate of failure, while the asymptotic and the bootstrap approaches (the bootstrap resamples are generated with the asymptotic method) both show a meaningful failure rate close to the coefficient bounds. The bootstrap rate of failure can be mitigated (see LN-N Model tables) by suppressing the resamples where the asymptotic method failed, but nonetheless they still show the largest failure rates across the board (while now on par with the asymptotic methods for low values of the coefficient, they still show significantly larger failure rates at 0.9) even when taking this into account.\n\n\n\nFailure rate under the N-N Model (continued below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAN_NA\nAF_NA\nAF2_NA\nAKG_NA\nBN_NA\nU_NA\nBPB_NA\nBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0.087\n0.075\n0.07\n0.102\n0\n0\n0.133\n0.13\n\n\nCCC_03\n0.035\n0.031\n0.031\n0.02\n0\n0\n0.026\n0.029\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.019\n0.017\n0.026\n0.018\n0\n0\n0.031\n0.025\n\n\nCCC_07\n0.015\n0.019\n0.008\n0.013\n0\n0\n0.043\n0.04\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.034\n0.045\n0.044\n0.049\n0\n0\n0.678\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNBPB_NA\nNBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0\n0\n\n\nCCC_03\n0\n0\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.001\n0.001\n\n\nCCC_07\n0.001\n0.001\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.002\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure rate under the lightly skewed LN-N Model (continued below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAN_NA\nAF_NA\nAF2_NA\nAKG_NA\nBN_NA\nU_NA\nBPB_NA\nBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0.04\n0.049\n0.045\n0.05\n0.082\n0\n0.057\n0.054\n\n\nCCC_03\n0.021\n0.016\n0.015\n0.014\n0\n0\n0.034\n0.026\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.01\n0.005\n0.007\n0.013\n0\n0\n0.018\n0.019\n\n\nCCC_07\n0.002\n0.003\n0.006\n0.004\n0\n0\n0.016\n0.008\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.009\n0.014\n0.011\n0.012\n0\n0\n0.236\n0.225\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNBPB_NA\nNBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0.054\n0.054\n\n\nCCC_03\n0.026\n0.026\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.019\n0.019\n\n\nCCC_07\n0.008\n0.015\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.225\n0.228\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure rate under the lightly highly LN-N Model (continued below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAN_NA\nAF_NA\nAF2_NA\nAKG_NA\nBN_NA\nU_NA\nBPB_NA\nBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0.036\n0.024\n0.025\n0.015\n0\n0\n0.057\n0.059\n\n\nCCC_03\n0.004\n0.001\n0.002\n0.001\n0\n0\n0.035\n0.04\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.002\n0.002\n0\n0.002\n0\n0\n0.004\n0.007\n\n\nCCC_07\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.003\n0.002\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.001\n0.003\n0.001\n0.005\n0\n0\n0.086\n0.095\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNBPB_NA\nNBPE_NA\n\n\n\n\nCCC_01\n0.059\n0.059\n\n\nCCC_03\n0.04\n0.04\n\n\nCCC_05\n0.007\n0.007\n\n\nCCC_07\n0.002\n0.002\n\n\nCCC_09\n0.095\n0.095\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen assessing the bias of the point estimates, the use of the bayesian MAP as one did not produce a larger bias than the other discussed approaches, which were generally on par.
